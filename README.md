# MongoDbGenericRepository
An example of generic repository implementation using the MongoDB C# Sharp driver (async)

Now available as a nuget package:


Covered by 100+ integration tests and counting.

The MongoDbGenericRepository is also used in [AspNetCore.Identity.MongoDbCore](https://github.com/alexandre-spieser/AspNetCore.Identity.MongoDbCore).

# Usage examples

This repository is meant to be inherited from. 

You are responsible for managing its lifetime, it is advised to setup this repository as a singleton.

Here is an example of repository usage, where the TestRepository is implementing 2 custom methods:

```csharp
    public interface ITestRepository : IBaseMongoRepository
    {
        void DropTestCollection<TDocument>();
        void DropTestCollection<TDocument>(string partitionKey);
    }
    
    public class TestRepository : BaseMongoRepository, ITestRepository
    {
        public TestRepository(string connectionString, string databaseName) : base(connectionString, databaseName)
        {
        }

        public void DropTestCollection<TDocument>()
        {
            MongoDbContext.DropCollection<TDocument>();
        }

        public void DropTestCollection<TDocument>(string partitionKey)
        {
            MongoDbContext.DropCollection<TDocument>(partitionKey);
        }
    }
```

## Instantiation

The repository can be instantiated like so:

```csharp
ITestRepository testRepository = new TestRepository(connectionString, "MongoDbTests");
```

If you prefer to reuse the same MongoDb database across your application, you can use the `MongoDatabase` from the MongoDb driver implementing the `IMongoDatabase` interface:

```csharp
var client = new MongoClient(connectionString);
var mongoDbDatabase = Client.GetDatabase(databaseName);
ITestRepository testRepository = new TestRepository(mongoDbDatabase);
```

## Adding documents
To add a document, its class must inherit from the `Document` class,  implement the `IDocument` or `IDocument<TKey>` interface:

```csharp
    public class MyDocument : Document
    {
        public MyDocument()
        {
            Version = 2; // you can bump the version of the document schema if you change it over time
        }
        public string SomeContent { get; set; }
    }
```

The `IDocument` and `IDocument<TKey>` interfaces can be seen below:

```csharp
    /// <summary>
    /// This class represents a basic document that can be stored in MongoDb.
    /// Your document must implement this class in order for the MongoDbRepository to handle them.
    /// </summary>
    public interface IDocument
    {
        Guid Id { get; set; }
        int Version { get; set; }
    }
    
    /// <summary>
    /// This class represents a basic document that can be stored in MongoDb.
    /// Your document must implement this class in order for the MongoDbRepository to handle them.
    /// </summary>
    public interface IDocument<TKey> where TKey : IEquatable<TKey>
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// The Primary Key, which must be decorated with the [BsonId] attribute 
        /// if you want the MongoDb C# driver to consider it to be the document ID.
        /// </summary>
        [BsonId]
        TKey Id { get; set; }
        /// <summary>
        /// A version number, to indicate the version of the schema.
        /// </summary>
        int Version { get; set; }
    }
```

## Partitioned collections
This repository also allows you to partition your document across multiple collections, this can be useful if you are running a SaaS application and want to keep good performance.

To use partitioned collections, you must define your documents using the PartitionedDocument class, which implements the IPartitionedDocument interface:
```csharp
    public class MyPartitionedDocument : PartitionedDocument
    {
        public MyPartitionedDocument(string myPartitionKey) : base(myPartitionKey)
        {
            Version = 1;
        }
        public string SomeContent { get; set; }
    }
```

This partitioned key will be used as a prefix to your collection name.
The collection name is derived from the name of the type of your document, is set to camel case, and is pluralized using a class taken from Humanizer (https://github.com/Humanizr/Humanizer).

```csharp
var myDoc = new MyPartitionedDocument("myPartitionKey");
_testRepository.AddOne(myDoc);
```

The above code will generate a collection named `myPartitionKey-myPartitionedDocuments`.

## CollectionName Attribute
It is now possible to change the collection name by using the `CollectionName` attribute:

```csharp
    [CollectionName("MyCollectionName")]
    public class MyDocument : Document
    {
        public MyDocument()
        {
            Version = 2;
        }
        public string SomeContent { get; set; }
    }
```
Documents of this type will be inserted into a collection named "MyCollectionName".

Please refer to the IntegrationTests (NET45) and CoreIntegrationTests (netstandard2.0) projects for more usage examples.
